### Challenges Overcome

In the development journey of our object detection model, we confronted and surmounted significant challenges, notably overfitting and class imbalanceâ€”common pitfalls that can impede model performance. Our strategy encompassed:
- **Innovative Data Augmentation**: Implementing advanced data augmentation techniques to enrich the training dataset, thereby enhancing the model's exposure to a diverse array of scenarios and reducing the risk of overfitting.
- **Weight Decay Implementation**: Adopting weight decay as a form of L2 regularization to prevent the over-parameterization of the model, ensuring that our model's weights remain manageable and conducive to generalization.
- **Class Balance Optimization**: Addressing class imbalance through tailored sampling methods and adjusting class weights within the loss function. This ensures equitable learning across all labels, promoting a balanced detection capability irrespective of the label frequency in the training dataset.
